				<p>The digital revolution and the birth of the Internet has given rise to the Age of Information. In this Age, technology has become so ubiquitous that often times, it goes unnoticed. As George Orwell predicted in his dystopian novel 1984, ignorance, today, has become bliss.</p>

				<p>As the new media age overflows with information with instant and unbounded access, it poses a major threat to an individual’s privacy. Today, rapidly emerging technologies are being used to feed a growing surveillance apparatus used by government and corporations to monitor citizens through their digital footprint. This system of surveillance has transformed from the traditional camera based feed to more invasive one that collects and analyses people’s data by exploiting their interactions with technology and the Internet. In such times, where does an individual’s choice and control lie? As a citizen of a democratic state, how does an individual’s fundamental rights and civil liberties affected? And, more importantly, with corporations and government bodies equally exercising this unrestricted surveillance, who holds accountability for the security of the people?</p>

				<p>‘Telescreens in the Dark’ is an online exhibition showcasing works of avant-grade new media artists and activists who address deep issues of government surveillance, transparency and online privacy through compelling narratives and experiences. The exhibition derives its name from the term ‘telescreen’ coined by Orwell in 1984 where the telescreens were giant screens used by a totalitarian government to monitor its citizens thus, symbolizing the misuse of technology. Orwell’s vision is strikingly similar to the present circumstances where an individual’s technological devices and agencies of interaction have become the very instruments of surveillance.</p>

				<p>The curated works throw a critical light on the apparatus of government agencies and corporations. Most of the artworks are audio and video based installations that make use of traditional surveillance technology to comment on a deeper underlying issue. They attempt to question the ethics of the systems of control and the limits of transparency. Marie Sester’s work reflects this examination of transparency as a democratic belief and its value in the social and political context. Her piece, Threatbox.us, ties violence, political control and interactive media into a single thread and places the audience at the center of this debate. By doing so, she aims to make the audience question the notions of seeing and being seen. Her work challenges the societal structure of power and critically examines the ideas of visibility, access and self-surveillance.</p>

				<p>The work of YoHa with Matthew Fuller, Endless War, tries to achieve a similar reaction by placing the audience at the center and showing them the power and immensity of data in the context of the Afghan War. It perceives the structures of power, governance and data through an extremely technical framework focusing on the machines generating the massive amount of data. Such a strong technical framework lays the foundation of another piece, The Beacon Frame by Julian Oliver and Danja Vasiliev. The artists attempt to provide the audience with an opportunity to engage with the raw technology that forms the massive surveillance systems used by the government. By placing the public in direct contact with the structures of surveillance, the work attempts to establish a critical dialog about unbounded access and misuse of technology.</p>

				<p>A commentary on the ubiquity and magnitude of surveillance is seen in James Bridle’s piece -Surveillance Spaulder. He addresses these issues by creating a metaphorical armor that protects “the wearer from unexpected and unseen blows from above.” The armor uses a tactile feedback mechanism to send an electrical signal to the wearer whenever he is in close proximity of a CCTV camera. The Spaulder serves to be a sharp reminder of overlapping information flows and the need to be invisible at times. The notion of invisibility is seen in the work of information artist and bio-hacker, Heather-Dewey Hagborg from a completely different perspective of genetic privacy. She highlights the concern for genetic privacy against process like collection of DNA and cloning which give rise to new forms of biological surveillance. Her work, Invisible, speculates the evolving role of science in surveillance technologies and raises questions about the control over one’s genetic data. Both Surveillance Spaulder and Invisible represent individualistic attempts at anonymity against the continuous violation of data and privacy.</p>

				<p>Surveillance Art is a new field of expression wherein artists use traditional methods of monitoring to comment on the process of surveillance. Such a compelling commentary is  reflected in works of Stanza and Dries Depoorter. The Agency At The End Of Civilisation by Stanza is an audio and video based installation which makes the audience the observer of surveillance, instead of the victim. It merges the fictional and the surveilled to form a captivating narrative about the years of CCTV monitoring. Depoorter’s piece, Seattle Crime Cams, also uses the traditional CCTV cameras to stream live video, which is combined with audio to create a voyeuristic experience. Depoorter’s work examines the notion of privacy, at times by violating his own, to make the audience aware of the possibilities of such an invasion.</p>

				<p>The idea and the importance of invisibility is best reflected in Hito Steyerl’s work, How Not to be Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational .MOV File. Her work, humorously, demonstrates ways to remain invisible in a world filled with tracking devices. At some point, the video narrates that the “most important things want to remain invisible. Love is invisible. War is invisible. Capital is invisible.” Steyerl’s work is a beautiful reflection on issues of feminism and militarization in the contemporary society. Through her idea of measuring the world as an image, she critiques the mass proliferation and dissemination of images by digital technologies.</p>

				<p>Lastly, Sorting Daemons by artist David Rokeby is a simple, yet predictive picture of what the future of surveillance might be, especially as machines become intelligent and capable of self-learning. David describes his work as an attempt to understand the difference between computers and humans and what happens when one start behaving like another. His investigations lie in realms of machine consciousness and its overlap with human intelligence.</p>

				<p>Together, these artworks stir a critical thought in the audience about privacy and the structures of surveillance that they live under. They examine the powers of the visible and transparent. In the book, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Michel Foucault quotes - “Disciplinary power is exercised through its invisibility”. Such an invisible disciplinary power has already started to convert affect one’s freedom by self-censorship. And with Artificial Intelligence being the latest fad of research, it is disturbing to imagine the integration of surveillance structures with machine consciousness. These artworks are a dire reminder of Orwell’s dystopian vision manifesting before us and an attempt to raise questions about survival in such a world.</p>
